Common SQL Query Patterns:

1. Total Sales:
   SELECT SUM(amount) as total_sales FROM sales;

2. Sales by Product:

   FROM sales GROUP BY product ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

3. Sales by Region:
   SELECT region, SUM(amount) as total_revenue, COUNT(*) as num_sales 
   FROM sales GROUP BY region ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

4. Sales in Date Range:

5. Top N Products by Revenue:
   SELECT product, SUM(amount) as revenue FROM sales 
   GROUP BY product ORDER BY revenue DESC LIMIT 5;

6. Average Sale by Product:
   SELECT product, AVG(amount) as avg_sale FROM sales GROUP BY product;

7. Sales by Customer Type:
   SELECT customer_type, COUNT(*) as count, SUM(amount) as total 
   FROM sales GROUP BY customer_type;

8. Monthly Sales Summary:
   SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', date) as month, SUM(amount) as total 
   FROM sales GROUP BY month ORDER BY month;

9. Sales Over Threshold:
